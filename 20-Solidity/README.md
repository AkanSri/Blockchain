# Unit 20 - "Joint Savings Account"

## Steps to Test:
Initial Balance of Accounts (Ganache):
1. Deployed contract on Remix with account: 0x21E35D02bCC349eDCD31DBa281A59DeAb200aDE7
2. Used the `setAccounts` function to define the authorized Ethereum addresses that will be able to withdraw funds from your contract.
Set Accounts:
- 0x0719f6FbfA730Aae452Ed4cF354B5a9C8192C3Dc (aka Solidity HW1)
- 0x21E35D02bCC349eDCD31DBa281A59DeAb200aDE7 (aka Solidity HW2)

3. Transaction 1: Send 1 ether from Solidity HW1
Account Balance and Contract Balance:


4. Transaction 2: Send 10 ether from Solidity HW1
Account Balance and Contract Balance:


5. Transaction 3: Send 5 ether from Solidity HW2
Account Balance and Contract Balance:


6. Transaction 4: Withdraw 5 ether into Solidity HW1
Account Balance and Contract Balance:

7. Transaction 5: Withdraw 10 ether into Solidity HW2
Account Balance and Contract Balance:
